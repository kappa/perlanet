=head1 NAME

Perlanet - A program for creating web pages that aggregate web feeds (both
RSS and Atom).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $perlanet = Perlanet->new;
  $perlanet->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perlanet is a program for creating web pages that aggregate web feeds (both
RSS and Atom). Web pages like this are often called "Planets" after the Python
software which originally popularised them. Perlanet is a planet builder
written in Perl - hence "Perlanet".

The emphasis on Perlanet is firmly on simplicity. It reads web feeds, merges
them and publishes the merged feed as a web page and as a new feed. That's all
it is intended to do. If you want to do more with your feeds (create feeds
from inputs that don't publish feeds, filter or transform them in complex ways
or publish them in interesting ways) then Perlanet isn't the right software
for you. In that case I recommend that you take a look at Plagger - which is
another feed aggregator, but one that is far more complex and, therefore, far
more flexible.

For most uses, you probably don't want to use the Perlanet module. The
L<perlanet> command line program is far more likely to be useful.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

  my $perlanet = Perlanet->new([ $config_filename ]);

The constructor method. Can be passed the filename of a configuration
file (default C<./perlanetrc>) or a hashref of initialisers.

For a detailed explanation of the configuration file contents, see
L<perlanet/CONFIGURATION FILE>.

=head3 Customised use (advanced)

  my $perlanet = Perlanet->new(\%custom_attr_values);

Perlanet is a L<Moose> class, if the configuration file doesn't
provide enough flexibility, you may also instantiate the attribute
values directly.

See L</ATTRIBUTES> below for details of the key/value pairs to pass in.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item cfg

A hashref of configuration data. This is filled from the configuration
file if supplied. Use this if you want an alternative to the YAML
format of the file.

=item ua

An instance of L<LWP::UserAgent>. Defaults to a simple agent using C<<
$cfg->{agent} >> as the user agent name, or C< Perlanet/$VERSION >.

=item opml

An instance of L<XML::OPML::SimpleGen>. Optional. Defaults to a new
instance with C<< $cfg->{title} >> as it's title.

=item cache

An instance of L<CHI>. Optional. Defaults to a new instance with the
root_dir set to C<< $cfg->{cache_dir} >>, if it was supplied.

=item cutoff

An instance of L<DateTime> which represents the earliest date for
which feed posts will be fetched/shown.

=item feeds

An arrayref of L<Perlanet::Feed> objects representing the feeds to
collect data from.

=item tidy

An instance of L<HTML::Tidy> used to tidy the feed entry contents
before outputting. For default settings see source of Perlanet.pm.

=item scrubber

An instance of L<HTML::Scrubber> used to remove unwanted content from
the feed entries. For default settings see source of Perlanet.pm.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 fetch_feeds

Called internally by L</run> and passed the list of feeds in L</feeds>.

Attempt to download all given feeds, as specified in the C<feeds> attribute. Returns a list of 
L<Perlanet::Feed> objects, with the actual feed data loaded. 

NB: This method also modifies the contents of L</feeds>.

=cut

      }
    }

  return @valid_feeds;
}

=head2 select_entries

Called internally by L</run> and passed the list of feeds from L</fetch_eeds>.

Returns a combined list of L<Perlanet::Entry> objects from all given feeds.

The returned list has been filtered according to any filters set up in the L<perlanet/CONFIGURATION>. 

=cut

}

=head2 sort_entries

Called internally by L</run> and passed the list of entries from L</select_entries>.

Sort the given list of entries into created order for aggregation. Takes a list of
L<Perlanet::Entry>s, and returns an ordered list. Modification time
of entries is not taken into account.

=cut

sub sort_entries {
  my ($self, @entries) = @_;

      <=>
    ($a->issued || $day_zero)
  } @entries;
}

=head2 clean

Clean a content string into a form presentable for display. By default, this
means running the content through both HTML::Tidy and HTML::Scrubber. These 2
modules are configurable by override the L</tidy> and L</scrubber> attributes. If
you do not wish to use HTML::Tidy/HTML::Scrubber or do something more complex,
you may override this method.

Takes a string, and returns the cleaned string.

=cut

sub clean {
  my ($self, $content) = @_;

  my $scrubbed = $self->scrubber->scrub($content);
  my $clean = $self->tidy->clean(utf8::is_utf8($scrubbed)

        : decode('utf8', $scrubbed));

  return $clean;
}

=head2 build_feed

Called internally by L</run> and passed the list of entries from
L</sort_entries>.

Takes a list of L<Perlanet::Entry>s, and returns a L<Perlanet::Feed>
that is the actual feed for the planet.

=cut

    self_link   => $self_url,
    id          => $self_url
  );

  $f->add_entry($_) for @entries;

  return $f;
}

=head2 render

Called internally by L</run> and passed the feed from L</build_feed>.

Render the planet feed as a page. By default, this uses L<Template>
Toolkit to render to an HTML file, but can be overriden to render to
wherever you need.

Takes a L<Perlanet::Feed> as input (as generated by L<build_feed>, the
result is output to the configured C<< $cfg->[page}{file> >>.

=cut

sub render {
  my ($self, $feed) = @_;

      binmode => ':utf8'
    }
  ) or croak $tt->error;

  return;
}

=head2 save

Called internally by L</run> and passed the L<Perlanet::Feed> from
L</build_feed>.

Save the feed XML to a file on disk.

=cut

sub save {
  my ($self, $feed) = @_;

  open my $feedfile, '>', $self->cfg->{feed}{file}
    or croak 'Cannot open ' . $self->cfg->{feed}{file} . " for writing: $!";
  print $feedfile $feed->as_xml($self->cfg->{feed}{format});
  close $feedfile;

  return;
}

=head2 update_opml

Updates the OPML file of all contributers to this planet. If the L<opml>
attribute does not have a value, this method does nothing, otherwise it inserts
each author into the OPML file and saves it to disk.

Uses the list of feeds from the L<perlanet/CONFIGURATION>.

=cut

sub update_opml {
  my $self = shift;

  return unless $self->opml;
